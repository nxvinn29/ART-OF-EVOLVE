# 🖼️ Image Assets

This directory contains all the static image assets used in the application.

## 📂 Structure

- `onboarding/`: Illustrations for the onboard flow.
- `badges/`: Gamification badges (PNG format).
- `placeholders/`: Temporary placeholders if any.

## 📏 Guidelines

- **Format**: use **SVG** for icons/vectors and **WebP** or **PNG** for raster images.
- **Naming**: `snake_case` (e.g., `user_avatar_placeholder.png`).
- **Optimization**: Please compress images before adding them to keep the app size small.
